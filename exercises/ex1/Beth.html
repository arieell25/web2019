                    She is a veterinarian who specializes in horse surgery, a job she internally
                    feels to be beneath her and is often defensive when her career is compared 
                    to human medicine.<p>which thrives in defiance of his proven mediocrity. Several episodes have 
                    dealt with Beth's deep dissatisfaction with her life, stemming from her belief 
                    that she has <b><i>"settled"</i></b> in her marriage, family, and job.
