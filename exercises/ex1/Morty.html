                    Morty is a good kid but he is easily distressed. 
                    He is often reluctant to follow Rick's plans,and 
                    <p>he often ends up traumatized by the unorthodox and
                    morally questionable methods <b><i>Rick</i></b> uses to 'fix' situations.
